## Project Background 🌧️🌩️📅

The Look Around Your Home project started in 2023, a year when Hong Kong encountered a series of extreme weather events. In September 2023, the city experienced the wrath of Super Typhoon Saola and a phenomenal rainstorm. ⛈️🌪️📆

Super Typhoon Saola brought fierce winds with a maximum sustained speed of 230 kilometers per hour. It was the second most intense tropical cyclone in the South China Sea since 1950. Hong Kong even issued a Hurricane Signal No. 10, the highest level, for the first time since Super Typhoon Mangkhut in 2018. 🌀🌊🌪️

During the same month, a low-pressure trough associated with the remnants of Tropical Cyclone Haikui caused prolonged torrential rain. The Black Rainstorm Warning was issued for a record-breaking 16 hours and 35 minutes, marking the longest duration since the introduction of the rainstorm warning system in 1992. 🌧️⛈️☔

These extreme weather events, along with heavy rainfall, resulted in an all-time high September rainfall of 1,067.1 millimeters. This amount was more than three times the normal level and surpassed the previous record set in September 1952. ☔🌧️🌊

## Project Collaboration and Purpose 🤝🌟❤️

The Look Around Your Home project was born out of inspiration from Prof. Tao in 2023 who encourage me to create useful and meaningful projects that help others, utilizing the government-supported public resources. The project aims to provide useful and timely information to Hong Kong residents during extreme weather conditions. 🌟🌧️🤝

This project is based on Google Script as serverlsess microservices and Google Spreadsheet as the SQL database. I've tapped into the power of technology to bring you this thrilling experience. 🚀💻🔒

The Look Around Your Home project is intended for non-commercial purposes, and I am open to collaborations. If you're interested in learning more details or seeking collaboration opportunities, please don't hesitate to contact me. Together, let's make our communities safer and more informed. 👥🌍💡

Thank you for joining us in the Look Around Your Home project! I hope this project brings you excitement, laughter, and a newfound appreciation for both extreme weather and the power of technology. Enjoy your undercover adventures! 📸🏠🌆
